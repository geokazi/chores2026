# Weekly Digest Enhancement: Personalized Family Scorecard

**Date**: January 23, 2026
**Status**: ✅ Implemented
**Related**: [Notifications: Calendar + Email + Badges](../milestones/20260122_notifications_calendar_email_badges.md)

---

## Executive Summary

Transform the existing "Week Ahead" email digest from a simple event list into a comprehensive **personalized family scorecard** — the weekly engagement email that no competitor offers. This creates a defensible moat by delivering unique value that users can't get from any calendar app or chore tracker.

---

## Competitive Analysis

### What Competitors Offer

| App | Weekly Email | Content | Personalization |
|-----|-------------|---------|-----------------|
| **OurHome** | None | — | — |
| **Homey** | None | — | — |
| **S'moresUp** | None | — | — |
| **Greenlight** (finance) | Weekly spending summary | Transaction list | Per-child spending |
| **Strava** | Weekly recap | Distance, pace, PRs | Segment performance |
| **Duolingo** | Streak reminders | "Don't lose your streak!" | Streak-focused only |

### Key Insight

**No family chore app sends a personalized weekly scorecard email.**

Strava's weekly recap is the gold standard for engagement emails — it combines stats, achievements, and social comparison to drive re-engagement. We can replicate this pattern for family chores.

### The Moat

A personalized weekly digest creates switching cost because:
1. **Historical context**: "You've earned $45 over 6 weeks" — can't replicate in a new app
2. **Family comparison**: Leaderboard position is family-specific
3. **Trend data**: Week-over-week improvement is unique to the household
4. **Anticipation**: Parents look forward to Sunday morning family stats

## Current Digest (Before)

```
Subject: Week Ahead for the Kariuki Family

- This Week's Events (3 items)
- Last Week's Highlights:
  - Chores completed: 18/22 (82%)
  - Top earner: Julia (45 pts)
```

**Problems**: Generic, no engagement hook, doesn't showcase app value.

## Enhanced Digest (After)

### 7 Sections (Pareto-ordered by engagement value)

| # | Section | Data Source | Value |
|---|---------|-------------|-------|
| 1 | Weekly Scorecard | `chore_transactions` | Completion % + delta vs last week |
| 2 | Family Leaderboard | `family_profiles.current_points` | All members ranked |
| 3 | Top Earner Spotlight | `chore_transactions` (weekly sum) | Who earned most THIS week |
| 4 | Streak Status | `chore_transactions` (consecutive days) | Active streaks + encouragement |
| 5 | Family Earnings | `chore_transactions` (weekly sum) | Total $ earned this week |
| 6 | Family Goal Progress | `families.settings` JSONB | Progress toward weekly goal |
| 7 | Upcoming Events | `family_events` | Next 7 days (existing) |

### Insight One-Liners

Personalized observations generated from data patterns:

| Condition | Insight |
|-----------|---------|
| Completion > 90% | "Your family crushed it this week!" |
| Week-over-week improvement > 20% | "Up X% from last week — great momentum!" |
| New streak started | "[Name] started a new streak — 3 days and counting!" |
| Goal reached | "Family goal reached! Everyone earned the bonus!" |
| Perfect week (100%) | "PERFECT WEEK! Every single chore completed!" |
| Top earner change | "[Name] takes the lead this week!" |
| Longest streak in family | "[Name] has the longest streak at X days!" |

## Technical Implementation

### Enhanced DigestContent Interface

```typescript
interface DigestContent {
  familyName: string;
  parentName: string;
  events: Array<{ date: string; title: string; time?: string; emoji?: string }>;
  stats: {
    choresCompleted: number;
    choresTotal: number;
    prevWeekCompleted: number;
    prevWeekTotal: number;
    topEarner?: { name: string; points: number };
  };
  leaderboard: Array<{ name: string; points: number; streak: number }>;
  weeklyEarnings: number;
  goalProgress?: {
    target: number;
    current: number;
    achieved: boolean;
    bonus: number;
  };
  insights: string[];
}
```

### Data Queries (Additional)

1. **Previous week transactions** — for week-over-week delta
2. **All family members with current_points** — leaderboard
3. **Weekly earnings per member** — from `chore_transactions` this week
4. **Goal settings** — from `families.settings` JSONB
5. **Streak calculation** — consecutive days from `chore_transactions`

### Streak Calculation (Server-Side)

For the digest, calculate actual daily streaks:
```typescript
// Group transactions by profile_id and date
// Count consecutive days ending at today or yesterday
// A streak ends when there's a gap day with no completions
```

## Updates

### January 25, 2026 — Behavioral Insights Integration

The digest was enhanced as part of [Priority 1: Behavioral Insights](../planned/20260125_rewards_market_strategy.md):

- **Streak recovery**: `calculateStreak()` now uses `diffDays <= 2` (allows 1 gap day)
  instead of strict `diffDays === 1`. Prevents single-miss frustration.
- **Template-aware consistency %**: `calculateConsistency(dates, expectedPerWeek)` computes
  30-day consistency as `activeDays / Math.round(expectedPerWeek * 30/7)`. Uses
  `getExpectedDaysForProfile()` from insights-service to derive expected days from
  the family's rotation template (e.g., Weekend Warrior = 5d/week, Daily Basics = 7d/week).
  Ensures consistency % matches the Habit Insights page exactly.
- **Leaderboard type updated**: `{ name, totalPoints, weeklyPoints, streak, consistency }`
- **Email template**: Shows consistency % alongside streak badge in leaderboard rows.
- **SMS template**: Appends consistency % after streak count.
- **Insight one-liner**: High consistency (80%+) generates "habit forming!" insight.

**January 25, 2026 — Shared Utility Consolidation**

- **No duplicate code**: `email-digest.ts` now imports `calculateStreak`, `calculateConsistency`,
  and `getExpectedDaysForProfile` from `insights-service.ts` instead of defining local copies.
  Single source of truth for all date math — if the streak algorithm changes, it updates
  everywhere automatically.
- **Unit tests**: 21 tests in `insights-service_test.ts` cover the shared utilities,
  including edge cases for timezone conversion, gap-day recovery, and deduplication.

### January 24, 2026 — P1-P4 Financial Features Integration

The digest was enhanced to include all four financial education features:

**New Sections Added (in priority order)**:

| Priority | Section | Data Source | Content |
|----------|---------|-------------|---------|
| P1 | **Behavioral Insights** | `chore_transactions` | Trend direction (📈/📉/➡️), avg consistency %, active days, top performer |
| P2 | **Kid Balances** | `family_profiles.current_points` | Per-kid point balance + dollar value |
| P3 | **Rewards This Week** | `choretracker.reward_purchases` | Pending + fulfilled rewards |
| P4 | **Savings Goals** | `family_profiles.preferences` | Goal progress bars with percentages |
| P2 | **Payouts This Week** | `chore_transactions` (cash_out) | Total payouts with per-kid breakdown |

**Updated DigestContent Interface**:

```typescript
interface DigestContent {
  // ... existing fields ...

  // P1-P4: Financial education features
  behavioralInsights: {
    trendDirection: "improving" | "stable" | "declining";
    avgConsistency: number;
    totalActiveDays: number;
    topPerformer?: { name: string; consistency: number };
  };
  balances: Array<{ name: string; points: number; dollars: number }>;
  rewardsThisWeek: {
    pending: Array<{ kidName: string; rewardName: string; icon: string }>;
    fulfilled: Array<{ kidName: string; rewardName: string; icon: string }>;
  };
  savingsGoals: Array<{ kidName: string; goalName: string; icon: string; current: number; target: number; percent: number }>;
  payoutsThisWeek: Array<{ kidName: string; amount: number }>;
  dollarValuePerPoint: number;
}
```

**New Insight One-Liners**:

| Condition | Insight |
|-----------|---------|
| Trend improving + 70%+ consistency | "📈 Family habits are improving — X% consistency!" |
| Trend declining | "📉 Consistency dropped this week — a fresh start awaits!" |
| Savings goal ≥90% | "🎯 [Name] is X% away from [goal]!" |
| Rewards pending | "🎁 X reward(s) waiting to be given!" |
