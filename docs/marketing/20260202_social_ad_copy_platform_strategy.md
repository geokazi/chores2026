**Date**: February 2, 2026

## 3 Ad Copy Variations

### Ad 1: The "Nag-Free" Parent (Pain-focused)

**Headline:** Stop Being the Chore Police

**Primary Text:**
You've asked them 5 times. They still "forgot."

ChoreGami ends the nagging cycle. Automatic reminders mean the app does the asking—not you. Kids see their tasks, earn points, and actually do them.

Setup takes 2 minutes. No app to download.

**CTA:** Try It Free

**Visual suggestion:** Split image: frustrated parent on left / calm parent on couch while kid does dishes on right

---

### Ad 2: The Fairness Fix (Solution-focused)

**Headline:** "That's Not Fair!" — Problem Solved

**Primary Text:**
When kids can SEE who's doing what, the arguments stop.

ChoreGami rotates tasks automatically so everyone gets a fair share. Points, streaks, and a family leaderboard turn "I don't want to" into friendly competition.

No more keeping score in your head.

**CTA:** Create Your Household

**Visual suggestion:** Mockup of the leaderboard showing fair distribution / happy siblings high-fiving

---

### Ad 3: The Gamification Hook (Benefit-focused)

**Headline:** Turn Chores Into a Game They Want to Play

**Primary Text:**
Your kids will actually ASK what chores are available today.

Points they can earn. Streaks they want to keep. A leaderboard that drives friendly sibling rivalry.

ChoreGami makes chores feel like leveling up—not punishment. Works on any device, setup in 2 minutes.

**CTA:** Start Free Today

**Visual suggestion:** Kid excited checking phone / confetti celebration animation / point counter going up

## Platform Recommendations (Ranked by Conversion Likelihood)

| Rank | Platform | Why It Works | Annual Conversion Potential | Est. CAC |
|------|----------|--------------|---------------------------|----------|
| **1** | **Facebook** | Unmatched parenting audience targeting. Target: parents with kids 6-17, interests in "parenting tips," "family organization," "chore charts." Retargeting + lookalikes from quiz completers. Highest volume + proven consumer app performance. | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Medium |
| **2** | **Pinterest** | High-intent users actively searching organization/parenting solutions. Pins have long shelf life. Audience skews toward planning-minded moms who value structure—perfect for annual commitment. | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Low-Medium |
| **3** | **Google Search** | Captures bottom-funnel intent: "chore app for families," "chore chart app kids," "fair chore rotation." Expensive but highest conversion rate. | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | High |
| 4 | Instagram | Same targeting as Facebook, better for lifestyle visuals. Stories/Reels work well. Slightly younger parent demographic. | ⭐⭐⭐ | Medium |
| 5 | YouTube | Pre-roll on parenting/family content. Good for brand awareness, longer path to conversion. | ⭐⭐ | Medium-High |
| 6 | LinkedIn | Skip—B2B focus doesn't match. | ⭐ | N/A |
