## Copywriting Principles

### The Pain-First Rule

**First 5 words must make parents think "That's ME."**

| Weak (Feature-First) | Strong (Pain-First) |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| "Chore management system" | "Stop being the bad guy" |
| "Helps parents stop nagging" | "Exhausted from repeating yourself?" |
| "Points-based rewards" | "Kids actually WANT to help" |
| "Digital delivery" | "See results in 30 days" |
| "Family access" | "Real peace at home" |
| "Prepaid subscription" | "Less than a coffee" |

### Parent Pain Points (from blog research)

| Pain Point | Emotional Phrase |
|------------|------------------|
| Constant repetition | "I already asked you 10 times!" |
| Checking/nagging | "Did you do it yet?" on repeat |
| Mental load | "Brain with 37 tabs open" |
| Burnout | "Exhausted from being the bad guy" |
| Arguments | "Chore wars every single day" |
| Reminder fatigue | "Feeling like a broken record" |
| Invisible labor | "No one notices what I do" |

### Proof Points (from blog)

- **"95% reduction in chore-related arguments"** (within 30 days)
- **"Kids started helping without being asked"**
- **71% of household mental tasks fall on mothers**
- **57% of parents report burnout**
