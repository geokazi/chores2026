## Implementation Recommendations

### Dynamic Question Flow

```
Q1 (Universal pain point)
  ↓
Q2 (Specific to persona - behavioral)
  ↓
Q3 (Desired outcome - aspirational)
  ↓
Q4 (Household context - demographic)
  ↓
RESULT with personalized message
  ↓
Email capture: "Get your personalized action plan"
```

### Copy Framework for Results

1. **Affirm their struggle** (75 words)
2. **Show the gap** between current state and desired state
3. **Provide hope** with specific solution
4. **Call to action** - "Join 10,000+ families who solved this"

### A/B Test Priority

1. Test Q1 options - which pain points resonate most
2. Test result page copy - short vs detailed
3. Test email gate timing - before vs after results
4. Test incentive - "Get early access" vs "Save your results"

## What Was Implemented

Based on this research, the landing page quiz (`islands/TeaserCards.tsx`) implemented:

### Simplified 3-Question Flow

| Question | Roommates | Just Me |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Q1: Current method | How do you currently split chores? | How do you currently manage tasks? |
| Q2: Pain point | What's your biggest frustration? | What's your biggest challenge? |
| Q3: Context | How many people in your household? | What would help you most? |

### 8 Persona Types Implemented

**Roommates**:
- `fair_seeker` - Values equality (Q2: unfair)
- `peace_keeper` - Tired of nagging (Q2: nagging)
- `system_builder` - Needs structure (Q1: none OR Q2: no_system)
- `optimizer` - Default type

**Just Me**:
- `motivation_seeker` - Needs motivation (Q2: motivation)
- `overwhelmed_organizer` - Too many tasks (Q2: overwhelmed)
- `memory_helper` - Forgets tasks (Q2: forgetting)
- `habit_builder` - Default type

### Key Insight Applied

The implementation uses **specific language busy parents actually say** ("That's not fair!", "I forgot", "After the 5th reminder"). This mirrors the "psychological assessment" pattern that converts 40%+ because users see themselves in the answers.
