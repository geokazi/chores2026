## Template 1: Happy User Request

**When**: User active 14+ days, completed 50+ chores

**Subject**: Your ChoreGami success story?

```
Hi [First Name],

I noticed your family has completed [X] chores since joining
ChoreGami — that's amazing! 🎉

Would you be willing to share a quick quote about your
experience? We'd love to feature your story on our website
to help other families discover ChoreGami.

In return, I'd love to give you 3 months of Family Plan
access as a thank you.

Just reply with:
1. A sentence or two about your experience
2. How to credit you (e.g., "Sarah M." or "Parent of 3")
3. (Optional) A family photo

Thanks for being part of the ChoreGami family!

— GK
```

**Follow-up (if no response in 5 days)**:

```
Hi [First Name],

Just following up on my note about featuring your family's
ChoreGami story. No pressure at all — I know you're busy!

If you have 30 seconds, a quick reply would mean a lot.
Even just one sentence like "ChoreGami helped us [X]"
would be perfect.

Thanks!
— GK
```

## Template 2: Goal Achiever

**When**: Family hit weekly goal 3+ weeks in a row

**Subject**: Your family is crushing it! 🏆

```
Hi [First Name],

Wow — your family just hit the weekly goal for the [3rd/4th/5th]
week in a row! That's seriously impressive.

I'd love to share your success with other families who are
just getting started. Would you mind sharing what's working
for you?

Something like:
"We [what changed] and now [result]"

Example: "We started using the leaderboard and now the kids
compete to finish chores first!"

As a thank you, I'll extend your Family Plan by 3 months.

Just hit reply — one sentence is perfect!

— GK
```

## Template 3: Video Testimonial Request

**When**: User already provided text testimonial

**Subject**: Quick video? (15 seconds max!)

```
Hi [First Name],

Thank you SO much for the testimonial — "[their quote]" is
going on our landing page this week!

Quick favor: would you be open to recording a 15-second
video saying something similar?

Just your phone, natural lighting, no editing needed.
Something like:

"Hi, I'm [Name], mom of [X]. Since we started using
ChoreGami, [one benefit]. Totally recommend it!"

Video testimonials convert 35% better than text, so this
would really help other families find us.

If you're up for it, just reply and I'll send easy
instructions. If not, no worries at all — the text
testimonial is already amazing!

— GK
```

**Video Instructions (send after they agree)**:

```
Awesome, thank you! Here's all you need:

📱 RECORDING TIPS:
- Horizontal orientation (landscape)
- Good lighting (face a window)
- Quiet room
- 15-30 seconds max

🎬 SCRIPT IDEA:
"Hi, I'm [Name]. We've been using ChoreGami for [X weeks/months].
[One specific benefit - e.g., 'My kids actually ask to do chores now'].
If you're looking for a way to make chores less of a battle,
I totally recommend it!"

Just record on your phone and reply to this email with
the video attached. That's it!

— GK
```

## Template 4: Trustpilot Review Nudge

**Subject**: 30 seconds to help another family?

```
Hi [First Name],

Your family has been using ChoreGami for [X] weeks now.
I hope it's been helpful!

Would you take 30 seconds to leave us a quick review
on Trustpilot? It helps other families find us.

👉 [Trustpilot Review Link]

Even just a star rating + one sentence makes a huge
difference.

As a small thank you, every review = $5 donated to
Feeding America's summer meals program. 🍎

Thanks for being part of our community!
